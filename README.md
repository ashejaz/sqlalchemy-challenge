# PART 1: SQLAlchemy Exploratory Analysis

For this challange, SQLAlchemy was used to query and manipulate a SQLite database using python in Jupyter Notebook.

2 tables containing climate data ('measurement' and 'stations') were reflected, and a session created. A series of queries were then performed on preciptation levels and temperature observations with visualisations created.

All data including charts can be found in the climate.ipynb file.

# PART 2: Climate API

The results of our previous query were then loaded into an app using Flask.
